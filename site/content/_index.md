# COMP4187: Parallel Scientific Computing II

This is the course webpage for the Numerical Algorithms part of
[COMP4187]({{< modulepage >}}). It collects the exercises, syllabus,
and notes. The source repository is [hosted on GitHub]({{< repo >}}).

## Syllabus

Topic 1: Spatial discretisation. Finite difference methods for partial differential equations (PDEs), stability, convergence, and consistency;

Topic 2: Time dependent PDEs. Stability constraints for time-dependent PDEs, connection to eigenvalue analysis;

Topic 3: Implicit ordinary differential equation (ODE) methods, and matrix representations of PDE operators;

Topic 4: Advanced algorithms for PDEs. Fast methods of solving PDEs, high order discretisation schemes.
