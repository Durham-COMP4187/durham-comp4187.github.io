# COMP4187: Parallel Scientific Computing II

This is the course webpage for [COMP4187]({{< modulepage >}}). It
collects the exercises, syllabus, and notes. The source repository is
[hosted on GitHub]({{< repo >}}).

This submodule builds on Numerical Algorithms I (Parallel Scientific Computing I) and introduces advanced topics in ODE integration schemes, and spatial discretisation.

## Syllabus

### Numerical Methods

Topic 1: Spatial discretisation. Finite difference methods for partial differential equations (PDEs), stability, convergence, and consistency;

Topic 2: Time dependent PDEs. Stability constraints for time-dependent PDEs, connection to eigenvalue analysis;

Topic 3: Implicit ordinary differential equation (ODE) methods, and matrix representations of PDE operators;

Topic 4: Advanced algorithms for PDEs. Fast methods of solving PDEs, high order discretisation schemes.

### Parallel Computing


- Distributed memory programming models: [MPI](https://www.mpi-forum.org).

- Parallel algorithms and data structures for finite difference codes.

- Irregular data distribution and load-balancing.

- Measurement and modelling. Analysis of achieved performance,
  performance models, including the Roofline model.
