title: "Lecture 4: Smoothers"
---

In this lecture we will finish covering efficient matrix storage from: [ipython notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/teaching.wence.uk/comp4187/code/finite-difference-II.ipynb).

Alternatively, you can run the notebook online without installing python.

After that we will start discussing efficient solvers for linear systems. This lecture will cover smoothers: [ipython notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/teaching.wence.uk/comp4187/code/smoothers.ipynb).

Alternatively, you can run the notebook online without installing python.

After the lecture have a look at the corresponding [exercise](https://teaching.wence.uk/comp4187/exercises/finite-differences).
