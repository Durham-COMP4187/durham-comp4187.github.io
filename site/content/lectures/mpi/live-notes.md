  We had a bit of a palaver with the network being terrible, so sorry
  to those attending online for the drop out in the second half.
  Fortunately the encore recording got everything, so we've got a
  complete record [the very last bit of the lecture got cut off, but I
  went through this a bit fast anyway so will recap next time].
  
  I got confused writing the speedup for strong and weak scaling (and
  didn't really define efficiency). I've fixed my todo note and added
  a few more details in the uploaded notes.

  I've requested a better room for next week, and will update if we
  get it.
