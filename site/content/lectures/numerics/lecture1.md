# Lecture 1

The jupyter notebook containing the lecture content can
be found at: 

[ipython notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/durham-comp4187.github.io/code/time-integration.ipynb)

I have been informed by CIS that the room was stil being set up when we used it, as a result the encore recording does not have sound. This should be fixed for future lectures. For this one the extensive notes included in the jupyter notebook will hopefully be sufficient. Any questions just ask by email or in the next lecture.
The video is now available at: [video](https://durham.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=c4ec84ba-0904-486b-ba03-adb800f57201)

We haven't gotten all the way through this notebook yet so we'll keep at it next week.

I do recommend you try the Taylor expansion bit on your own as well, we'll be using those quite a bit.
