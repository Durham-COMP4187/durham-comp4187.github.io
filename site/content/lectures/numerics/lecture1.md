The jupyter notebook containing the lecture content can
be found at: 

[ipython notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/teaching.wence.uk/comp4187/code/time-integration.ipynb)

The video is now available at: [video](https://durham.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=c4ec84ba-0904-486b-ba03-adb800f57201)

We haven't gotten all the way through this notebook yet so we'll keep at it next week.

I do recommend you try the Taylor expansion bit on your own as well, we'll be using those quite a bit.
