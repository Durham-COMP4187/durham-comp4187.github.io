The lecture will take place over zoom. A calender invite is available on duo. The zoom invite can also be found at [info](https://teaching.wence.uk/comp4187/notes/overview)).

Before the lecture it would be good if you can download the [ipython notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/teaching.wence.uk/comp4187/code/finite-differences.ipynb) and run it. You can see [jupyter](https://teaching.wence.uk/comp4187/setup/jupyter/) for instructions on how to run the notebook.

Alternatively, you can run the notebook online without installing python.

After the lecture a video recording has been placed on duo. I apologise, the very end of the video has been cut off due to a technical issue. The video is now available at: [video](https://durham.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=27e52d64-caf9-490d-b88b-ac4d00de701e)

The content of the whiteboard can be found below. It is also all contained in the ipython notebook itself.
