title: "Lecture 7: Multigrid"
---

We continue with the multigrid method: [ipython notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/teaching.wence.uk/comp4187/code/2DMultigrid.ipynb)

At this point you may want to have a look at the two exercises:
1. On two grid: [exercise](https://teaching.wence.uk/comp4187/exercises/two-grid). If you are unused to Fourier-analysis you will find this exercise quite challenging.
2. and on the construction of the coarse grid operator:  [exercise](https://teaching.wence.uk/comp4187/exercises/coarse-grid)

If you run into any issues, as always, feel free to ask.
