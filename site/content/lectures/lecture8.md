We finish the discussion of multigrid method: [ipython notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/teaching.wence.uk/comp4187/code/2DMultigrid.ipynb)


We will begin looking at time-stepping methods (for now in an ODE setting): [ipython notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/teaching.wence.uk/comp4187/code/time-integration.ipynb)
